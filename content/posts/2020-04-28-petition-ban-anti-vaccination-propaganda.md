The world community is divided into two camps and the struggle between them is for each undecided.
Many scientific minds and companies do not enter into discussion, believing that this is above their dignity and the belief in pseudoscientific nonsense and conspiracy theories do not concern them - these are the problems of the anti-vaccinators themselves and their environment.
But this is no longer the case.

In a difficult hour, the scientific community and any sane people must rally and resist the swelling hysteria of ignorance and obscurantism.

As freedom of speech is limited during the war, and now, faced with an unprecedented crisis - we must deny the right to speak of people whose actions affect all of humanity (the revival of forgotten diseases, the hunt for witches, the development of pseudoscience).

I offer all the major social networks (Facebook / Youtube / Instagram / Twitter):

1. At the company's level to implement a policy of content moderation and ban users promoting anti-vaccination.
2. At the interface's level to add the ability to report content or profile due to anti-vaccination propaganda.
